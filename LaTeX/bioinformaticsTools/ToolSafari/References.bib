  abstract        = {We have developed a simple and efficient system (ORF-FINDER) for selecting open reading frames (ORFs) from randomly fragmented genomic DNA fragments. The ORF-FINDER vectors are plasmids that contain a translational start site out of frame with respect to the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP). Insertion of DNA fragments that bring the initiating ATG in frame with GFP and that contain no stop codons (that is, ORFs) results in the expression of ORF-GFP fusion proteins. In addition, we have developed software (GeneWorks and GenomeAnalyzer) to predict the optimal insert size for maximizing the number of gene-coding ORFs and minimizing unintentionally selected non-coding ORFs. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the ORF-FINDER system to screen genomes for ORFs, we cloned yeast genomic DNA and succeeded in enriching for ORFs by 25-fold. Furthermore, we have shown that the vector can effectively isolate ORFs from the more complex genomes of eukaryotic parasites. We envision that ORF-FINDER will have several applications including genome sequencing projects, gene building from oligonucleotides and construction of expression libraries enriched for ORFs.},

The objective of this web server is to provide easy access to RNA and DNA folding and hybridization software to the scientific community at large. By making use of universally available web GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of portability of this software. Detailed output, in the form of structure plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency plots and 'energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single sequences. A variety of 'bulk' servers give less information, but in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. The portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold. This URL will be referred to as 'MFOLDROOT'.},
